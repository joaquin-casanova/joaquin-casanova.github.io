### Introduction
On several occasions, after a great investment of time, I have found pieces of information that I find valuable, but the dark side is that my browser ends up with almost 90 tabs open and more than once I have lost them for some reason (well, it is not so chaotic because I find my way back, but with time investment). With this in mind, and after searching the internet, I found the **SECOND BRAIN** book, so this is my intention to apply it and help others at the same time.
