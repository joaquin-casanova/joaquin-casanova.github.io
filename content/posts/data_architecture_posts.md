### Disclaimer
This post is WIP but I would to share you.

### Introduction
One of the DATA ENGINEERING TEAM's main objectives is to ensure data reliability and scalability; to achieve that, the infrastructure plays a main role.

### Data Architecture
The DevOps and SWE best practices play a fundamental role, we try to implement both in DE.

So far I used at least one year the following architecture:

The idea behind is focuses in:

> - TDD
> - Quick deploy
> - Decoupling SQL scripts
> - Continous Deployment and Integration
> - Production and Development enviroments

### How works?
1. We work following the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com//git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), which allows us to work on the differents requirements at the same time.

2. Every time somebody does a PR automatically runs the following tests (These tests also can run local):
    - Flake8
    - PyDocStyle
    - MyPY

3. We need somebody in the team to check our PR to merge in the development instance.

4. Finally it all works ok, we make a PR from DEV to MASTER. (The master branch only accepts PR from the DEV branch. )
