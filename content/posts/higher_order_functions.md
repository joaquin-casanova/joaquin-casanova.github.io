### Introduction
This year I set out to learn a new programming language just for fun and I've always been curious about web development so I chose JavaScript.

In the first few weeks I learned about syntax, DOM, primitive values, objects, scope, etc. but one thing that caught my attention was the concept of **Higher Order Functions**.

Disclaimer: maybe you use it but you didn't know the name.
